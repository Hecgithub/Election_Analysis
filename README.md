# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has give you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local 
congressional election. 

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who recieved votes. 
3. Calculate the total number of votes each condidate recieved. 
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won. 
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote. 

## Resources 
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that
    - There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
- County votes: 
    - Jefferson: 110.5% (38,855)
    - Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
    - Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,80
- The largest number of votes.
	-Denver over 80% of the votes
- The candidates were: 
    - Candidate Charles Casper Stockham

 ## Challenge Overview
 The election audit gives us a deeper understanding of where the highest number of votes by county. This gives us a broad understanding of where it is important to allocate resources when running for an election. Denver had more than 80% of the votes from all three counties. This is also a great opportunity to see what counties may potentially have more voters that are not voting and could be swayed for the next election.    
 
 ## Challenge Summary 
The script that was used tells us how many votes and the percentage there were by county and by the candidate. We can modify the script to tell us how many votes each candidate got from each county to give us a breakdown of who won in which counties. We could also modify the script to get the average amount of votes that each candidate got from each county.This script can be utilized with any election with few adjustments on swapping the CSV file and the code if there is more information to add.
